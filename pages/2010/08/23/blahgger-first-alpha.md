title: blahgger First Alpha
date: 2010-08-23

Hello all.

The blog that you are reading is running the first alpha version of my blogging 
software, blahgger.

blahgger is being developed as a lightweight, single-file (with external stylesheet)
 PHP/MySQL blogging solution. I undertook this as a bit of a personal challenge, 
 although I mainly wanted to avoid the bloat associated with the major-name 
 blogging CMS's (*cough*WordPress*cough*), which although provides modularity 
 and impressive features, just feels a bit too heavy for my needs: getting 
 things posted. So, I decided to write my own.

Current features include:

Full HTML posting
Commenting
Pagination
External Stylesheet
Simple edit-generate tables-edit-done installation process
Single-file portability
Auto-formatting
Sanitizing and HTML scraping for comments, to prevent abuse
Post permalinks
Unfortunately, I only have the front-end worked on. Once I have worked on the 
back-end to the point where it's usable (and I don't have to manually edit my
 MySQL tables to post and moderate), I will release it under the GPL.

Oh, it also has a logo, released under the Creative Commons 3.0-by-nd-nc license. 
Here it is:
