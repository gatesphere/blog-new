title: Quick MSPhere Update
date: 2010-08-26

I have set up a wiki for my site, and included a large section on the MSPhere framework. I will keep working on it as the framework progresses, and also intend on creating an "official" sort of webpage/landing/portal for MSPhere as well.
Linkity:

[MSPhere @ wiki.suspended-chord.info](http://wiki.suspended-chord.info/wikka.php?wakka=MSPhere)

[MSPhere homepage (future address, currently empty)](http://msphere.suspended-chord.info/)

That's all. Peace out.
