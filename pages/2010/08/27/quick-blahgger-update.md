title: Quick blahgger Update
date: 2010-08-27

I just updated blahgger to send an administrator configurable email address a message when a comment is posted on a post. This will help me keep track of comments here.
I'm also still working on the MSPhere documentation and coding. The wiki is coming along nicely, and I will have the MSPhere homepage up as soon as I get a few more of my ducks in a row involving a few things with the community (namely, a forum).

Thanks for reading, and keep tweaking.

That's all.
