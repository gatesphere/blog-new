title: MSPhere Documentation Updated (finally)
date: 2010-09-25

Hi all,

Just writing to let you know that I've updated the MSPhere documentation so that it matches the current state of the library. Still to do is write up the "how to create a new MSPhere project in CCSv4" article, but the framework itself is now fully documented.

Check it out [here](http://wiki.suspended-chord.info/wikka.php?wakka=MSPhere).

Keep tweaking~
