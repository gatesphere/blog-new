title: I just keep tweaking blahgger
date: 2010-10-18

Hi all,

Another small update for blahgger. I changed the text to justify alignment for posts and custom user content, and also moved the reCAPTCHA library into a module in order to allow more flexibility to blog maintainers if they don't wish to use the reCAPTCHA system. All a user has to do is set $enablemodule_recaptcha = FALSE; and this will prevent any reCAPTCHA related things from happening.

It's shaping up, I just wish I had more time to work on it... :(

Keep tweaking~
