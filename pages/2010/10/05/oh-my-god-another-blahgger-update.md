title: Oh my god, another blahgger update

Third one in a row, but this one is really minor.

I've simply added support for [ASCIIMathML](http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html). I have found the need to embed mathematical formulas in my posts occasionally, so this will help me format them nicely.

That's all.

Keep tweaking~
