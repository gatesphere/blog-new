title: A few bits of news

Hello all,

Just thought I'd update you on a few things I've been up to since the last time 
I posted (God! I'm bad at this keeping a schedule thing!).  In particular, I've 
coded up a few small tools, and launched the rebirth of ceekrt.  So... here's a 
short list of what I've done in the past month and a half plus change:

  - Submitted [grinder][1] to the February 2013 [PLTGames competition][2]
  - Wrote a small tabletop RPG manager within Leo: [rpg.leo][3]
  - Contributed a few small fixes to [easy6592][4] and [candelabra][5]
  - Added Markdown support to Leo: [leo-editor/markdown_support][6]
  - Wrote a minimaxing AI for the game [Button Up!][7] in [newLISP][8]: [fastendown][9]
  - Attempted to learn, and subsequently gave up on COBOL
  - Submitted [silica][10] to the March 2013 [PLTGames competition][11]
  - Wrote a small implementation of the [Mythic GM Emulator][12] in Python: [mythical-pie][13]
  - Wrote and relaunched a new version of my old pet project, [ceekrt][14], in Python with Flask
  - Launched the new version of [my portfolio pages][15]!

Looks like I've been busy.  Huh.

As for this blog, I swear it's not languishing... but I may be refocusing it once again, into sort of a catch-all for fun stuff.  Programming, science, math, game design, and observations and life musings will be the order of the day.  I still like the name a&rarr;ab, so I'll keep that.

Anyways, thanks for reading!
