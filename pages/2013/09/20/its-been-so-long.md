title: It's been so long...

So... here we are, 5 months without an update.  Man, I'm *really* bad at this whole blogging thing.

To the few readers I have, I'm sorry.  I have **not** fallen off the face of the Earth (at least
not yet!), I've just been busy.

Since it's been so long, I'd like to share a partial list of what I've been doing with myself
these past five months... I say partial because I haven't documented much of anything, so I can't
be sure that I'm gathering it all.  Oh well, here we go:

  - I've become a contributing member of the [Leo Editor](http://leoeditor.com/) team
    - Added markdown support to the viewrendered.py plugin
    - Added printing support with the printing.py plugin
    - Set up the automated API docs at [ReadTheDocs](http://readthedocs.org)
    - Set up the automated nightly [github mirror](http://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor.git) of the source code
    - Contributed to the [Leo Blog](http://leo-editor.github.io) (earlier today, actually!)
  - I've become pretty enamoured with the game [Smite](http://smitegame.com/)
    - Thor, Xbalanque, and Nieth are ownage, by the way
  - I've picked up some game design projects
    - The main one is Mint Fudge, my hack of Fudge
      - Wrote the entire first version of the Mint Fudge book, threw it away
      - Rebuilt the whole system from scratch - whoo!
      - Writing the new book now
    - Working on getting a small print-on-demand publishing imprint going
    - Purchased a few related domains...
  - I've recently started playing with [libtcod](http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/)
    - I think I'm going to resurrect my two dead roguelike projects, this time in python+libtcod
  - Wrote and released [Underwood Writer](https://github.com/gatesphere/underwood-writer)
  - Started writing creatively... knocked out a few short stories and working on some characters
  - Figured out how to bake kickass scones
  - A bunch of other fun stuff I can't remember at the moment, I'm sure...
  
Well, the fact that I can't remember this stuff bothers me.  Combined with a general lack of motivation
lately (you'd never be able to tell from the outside, apparently), I've decided to work out a new productivity
system for myself.  I'll be posting that in another article soon.

Additionally, I have a few other plans, both short-term and long-term:

  - Roguelikes!
  - RPGs!
  - Leo work!

...yeah.  I need to get busy.

Thanks for reading this ramble.  I'll keep this place more up to date, I swear!
