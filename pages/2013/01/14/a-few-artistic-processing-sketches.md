title: A few artistic Processing sketches

Last Friday, I was at a pizza/tea party/gathering at a friend's house.  
Almost everyone that showed up was a creative type, so we did a sort of 
reverse-charades thing, where we picked ideas out of a hat and had to 
do something creative with them in 5 minutes, and then went around the 
room showing them off.

Being me, I decided to do short Processing sketches.

We only did two rounds of this... so here's what I came up with.

The first word was "beastly."

[code for "beastly"](https://github.com/gatesphere/blog-resources/tree/master/downloads/source/beastly)

The second was "scandalous."

It was fun. :)
