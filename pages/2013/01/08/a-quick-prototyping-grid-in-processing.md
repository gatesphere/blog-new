title: A quick prototyping grid in Processing

First post of the new year!

This one is a quick one though, just wanted to share a quick little 
idea I whipped up in Processing that could help others make Processing
sketches.  It's kind of a meta-sketch.

Basically, it's a customizable gridline maker, so that you can easily 
line things up in your sketches without doing too much math, and just 
focus on making art.  When you don't want the grids anymore, just change 
the `GRID_DRAW` variable to `false`, and you're good to go!

Code is in this gist:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4486700.js"></script>

It's in the public domain, so go mad.

Thanks for reading.
