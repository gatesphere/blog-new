title: LTD Week Eight

Another decently busy week:

  - Work
    - Created some unix users
    - Worked with some vendors on some file transfer jobs
    - Worked on getting a PHP module installed for our website
    - Worked a bit on our new t5-2 hardward w/r/t disk multipathing
  - Responsibility
    - Did my Tabata every day (yeah! back on track!)
    - Got my driver-side mirror fixed (it had a crack -- ice damage)
  - Leisure
    - Read MicroFudge
    - Read ERP ('Elegant Role Playing')
    - Fixed a 'huge font' issue in Leo
    - Patched Leo to make @rclick nodes create commands like @command and @button nodes
    - Refactored my @nodewatch definitions for LTD into a single script (keep it DRY)
    - Scripted an @rclick to create weekly reports for LTD progress
    - Worked on Kahl a bit
    - Read Crawl! #3
    - Removed ceekrt from my site... it's about time
    - Updated orison's software

Later on today, I intend to do an updated version of my original LTD article, explaining how it works now, and sharing my scripts at the moment.
