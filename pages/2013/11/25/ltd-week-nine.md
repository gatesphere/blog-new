title: LTD Week Nine

Very busy week, work-wise.  Not much outside of work though...

  - Work
    - Got our new t5-2 hardware talking to the storage array
    - Scripted a few ftp jobs
    - Added a server to our monitoring system
    - Set up an install server for Solaris 10 01/13 SPARC
    - Added some new LUNs to several machines
    - Prepped for OS upgrades...
  - Responsibility
    - Maintained my tabata routine
  - Leisure
    - Fixed a minor DDOS attack (from Google's address space?!?) on my servers... wtf?
    - Read Crawl! #4
    - Read Crawl! #5
    - Rewrote the Mint Fudge sketchy-sketch
    - Updated orison's software

Doesn't look like much, but it was a lot of time consuming BS.  Also lots of planning.
