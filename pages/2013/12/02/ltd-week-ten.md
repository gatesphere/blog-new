title: LTD Week Ten

Less than average productivity this week, but that's to be expected with the US Holidays.  Here's a recap:

  - Work
    - Performed OS upgrades and patches on some blackboard servers
    - Installed a PHP module on our webserver
    - Did a few DNS entries
    - Installed an emergency patch on blackboard right before Thanksgiving...
  - Responsibility
    - Looked at a new apartment (!)
    - Maintained my Tabata routine half-heartedly (meh... I'm getting bad about this.)
  - Leisure
    - Read The Manor #5
    - Read Crawl! #6
    - Read Crawl! #7
    - Fixed a few small Leo bugs (one related to quicksearch.py's theming, and one related to nodewatch.py's focusing behavior)
    - Updated orison's software
    - Played a crapton of Smite
    - Spent too much money online

Whoo!  Back to the grind.
