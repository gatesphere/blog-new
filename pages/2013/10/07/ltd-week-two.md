title: LTD Week Two

So, here we are with week two of LTD.  The system is holding up nicely.  Here's what I did this week:

  - Work: finished up a small job dealing with a file transfer issue
  - Work: worked on another small file transfer job
  - Work: finished a major apache migration project
  - Work: pushed some configuration changes to an application
  - Work: did some research on bare-metal restores for our various server types
  - Leisure: finished reading "The Song"
  - Leisure: started writing a long-form poem... more on that later, perhaps
  - Leisure: wrote the [rss.py](http://leo-editor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/leo.plugins.html#module-leo.plugins.rss) plugin for Leo
  - Leisure: worked on Mint Fudge
  - Responsibility: minor errands
  - Responsibility: started a daily [Tabata](http://tabatatraining.org/) routine
  
Not bad.  I'm still working the kinks out of the system, but it's keeping me productive and on track for the most part.
