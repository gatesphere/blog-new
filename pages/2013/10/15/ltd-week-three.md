title: LTD Week Three

Here's what I accomplished this past week:

  - Work: added a new disk to a server for backup space
  - Work: fixed a failed FTP job
  - Work: general maintainence
  - Responsibility: maintained my Tabata routine (man, that works well!)
  - Responsibility: bookkeeping
  - Responsibility: dug through some paperwork on the Affordable Care Act
  - Leisure: Prototyped a new type of Fudge die
  - Leisure: Updated my raspberry pi's software
  - Leisure: Scripted a "mark-task-done" button in Leo for LTD (difficult!)
  - Leisure: Did some minor updates to the rss.py Leo plugin
  - Leisure: Worked on a fantasy RPG campaign

A decent week, but room for improvement.
