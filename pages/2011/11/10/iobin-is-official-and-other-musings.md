title: iobin is official, and other musings
date: 2011-11-10

Hello all,

Another "quick update post" incoming...

So, my server had a disk failure Sunday morning. That took the entire suspended-chord.info domain offline (except email) for roughly 38 hours. But obviously it's up and running again. It should be back to normal, but I apologize in advance to anyone who happens upon a rogue 404 due to permissions errors. Sorry for the inconvenience.

In other news, I've been having discussions with Steve Dekorte, the progenitor of the Io programming language. He is just an awesome guy. We discussed my [iobin](http://iobin.suspended-chord.info/) project, and he ended up making them official! My binaries are linked on the front page of the [Io Language site](http://iolanguage.com/)! Happiness.

As for the rest of life... I'm currently working on some school projects and some small personal endeavors (like a web-based CV), but after that, I can get back to chipping away at the Io book, and preparing for the GREs. And developing an empirical boardgame balance tester. Interesting things, you know.

Anyways, just wanted to share.

Keep tweaking~
