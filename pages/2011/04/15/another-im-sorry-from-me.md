title: Another "I'm sorry" from me
date: 2011-04-15

Hello all,

So, recently I had to close the alpha test of ceekrt. I'm thinking of doing a postmortem, but basically, never invite friends to test.

I'm swamped at the moment still, but I see the light at the end of finals week approaching about a month away. So I will begin to work in earnest then. I get too wrapped up in my school work to really get anything else done. But, I have a few ideas for 43oh! Project of the Month entries, and I want to see them through this summer. I just need to get my hands on some continuous rotation servos and some more piezo elements.

I've also recently set up the development platform for my next major project, Muscover. I'm not going to say much about it, other than that my dev platform uses XAMPP, MongoDB, JQuery, and the 960 grid system. It involves a lot of learning, but I hope to have a very presentable product at the end of it.

And, that's that I suppose. I'll come back and work more soon, I promise!

Keep tweaking~
