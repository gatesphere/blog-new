title: Featured on TI's site, and free NXP board
date: 2011-04-20

Hello everyone,

Just thought I'd post that I've been featured on TI's site, twice.

The first was for my [TLV5620 work](http://e2e.ti.com/group/msp430launchpad/m/project/373466.aspx), although they used the pic from my TLV5618A post :P

The second was for my [LaunchPad based Glitchamin](http://e2e.ti.com/group/msp430launchpad/m/project/373478.aspx).

I also received an LPCXpresso LPC1114 board in the mail free, a day ago or so. Neat :)

That's all.

Keep tweaking~
