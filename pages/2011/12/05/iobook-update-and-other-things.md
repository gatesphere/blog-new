title: Iobook update, and other things
date: 05/12/2011

Hello all,

Wow, I do seem to go ages between posts, don't I?

Just a few little updates: I've started writing the book in earnest. I have the intro and chapters one and two done in draft form, just awaiting editing from a few friends and a professor. As far as that goes, I've been making awesome progress.

I've decided that at least three days a week, I will try to write a small, interesting program in Io. I'm calling these "mini code jams" and I've already written a few. The past few nights have been cellular automata implementations... I implemented a generic Wolfram code one-dimensional cellular automata on Sunday, and tonight I wrote a simple, inefficient, text-based version of Conway's Game of Life. I'm going to set up a github repo and keep my jams uploaded for the world to see. I'll link back here later.

That's about it, really. Thanks for reading!

Keep tweaking~
