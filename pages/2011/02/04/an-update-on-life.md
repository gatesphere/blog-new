title: An update on life
date: 04/02/2011

Hello all,

I've been away for far too long, it seems. Unfortunately, I was unable to do most of the things on that to-do list that I posted a while back. Life got in the way. I'm sure you all know how that is.

However, I am working on several projects right now. First and foremost is my thesis, which I am also using as a part of my AI course at the moment. Aside from that, I am working on a project for Web Services, which entails me rewriting ceekrt in JavaEE. Fun times :P

However, I do have some code for MSPhere to release, and I still have the TLV5618A library to port to it. Thanks to a few others, I have some submissions to add and make it more community based. So, be on the lookout for that. Also, I would absolutely love to release JEclap sometime soon. But that requires more work still.

Blahgger and the current iteration of ceekrt have taken a back seat for now, along with fileslave (which is still an early prototype). Work will resume on those as time permits (maybe this weekend?).

That's all I've got for now, just wanted to let you all know I'm still alive and kicking. :)

Keep tweaking~
