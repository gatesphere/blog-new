title: ELOCALC - an ELO ratings calculator

Hi all.

I wrote up a quick and dirty ELO ratings calculator in Common Lisp. It assumes a K value of 24, but that can be modified by rebinding the `*k*` symbol.

Code available: [here](https://github.com/gatesphere/blog-resources/raw/master/downloads/source/elocalc.l).

In other news, my development efforts have ground to a halt recently, as my father passed away just over a week ago. I'm taking some time to heal and mend, and we'll see where I'm at when I come back to this stuff. Thanks for understanding :)

Keep tweaking~
