So, this is the last week of classes for me, and I already have a list a mile long of things I want to do this summer, development wise. What will actually get accomplished is to be seen.

One thing that I know I'm working on will be a small web app that members of [43oh](http://43oh.com/) should appreciate... It's web based, and I'll offer them access to the beta test.

Aside from that, research opportunities have opened up all around me. I'm working on a small project involving cellular automata and networks that I'd like to expand once the semester is over. And I'm loving the Processing language.

Oh, and I'd love to write a roguelike for the Barnes & Noble nook (classic, not color). It'd be a neat intro to Android development, and fill a niche that is sorely empty on that platform. Of course, it would only run on rooted nooks, but it's still a neat project that I'll probably take up in my spare time.

Anyways, just thought I'd do a small update. Thanks for reading :)

Keep tweaking~
