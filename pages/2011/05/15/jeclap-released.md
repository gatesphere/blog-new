title: JEClap released!
date: 2011-05-15
tags: [code-dump]

The first version of JEclap has been released. It's minor, and probably useless to most people. And doesn't catch many errors. But, it's available, under the public domain.

Check it out: [JEclap official home page](http://jeclap.suspended-chord.info/).

Keep tweaking~
