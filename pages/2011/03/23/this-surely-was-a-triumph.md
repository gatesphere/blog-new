title: This surely was a triumph
date: 2011-03-23

Hello all,

I'm sorry I keep neglecting this blog, but I simply have been up to my ears in work. But, the wheels keep turning.

Since the last time I wrote, I've accomplished nothing in the domain of MSPhere or JEclap. As far as MSPhere goes, I might end up collaborating with the author of ["friendly launchpad"](https://github.com/chrishulbert/friendly_launchpad) in order to streamline the whole process. Things are still up in the air.

As far as development goes, I'm tied down with classes at the moment, but I have decided that I am going to get some serious work done this summer on my various projects, maybe even bringing [Muscover](http://suspended-chord.info/portfolio/inprogress/muscover-computing/) to life. Pretty much the only personal development I've been able to do is my brief step into the realm of algorithmic art, via the use of the [Processing](http://processing.org/) language. Those of you who follow my [deviantART page](http://suspended-chord.deviantart.com/) have seen some of the results of that, and I intend to have a larger gallery for display on my portfolio soon, possibly even later today.

In non-development related news:

I have also decided to place a donate button on my portfolio page, in an unobtrusive manner. This is not a way to beg for money, but just a way for me to potentially fund my endeavors. So far, everything I've done has been at personal cost to me. I have no problems with any of this, but from this point on, if anyone else feels like assisting, there is now that option available. There may even be a small perk in it for you, who knows... ;)

I have also started to work on my next release in the A Question Malformed series, Fluid, in earnest. I have some surprises in store, and also a lot of work ahead of me. Fluid will be my first full-length that was actually conceived as an album (the stuff in //shards was just a collection of songs that didn't fit anywhere else), but I hope to have the whole shebang finished by the end of August. I have already recorded 2 out of 12 tracks, and I have around 3 others written. This release is looking to cost me around $170 for the 10 physical copies, so there's another reason for the donate button.

Anyways, thanks for reading.

Keep tweaking~
