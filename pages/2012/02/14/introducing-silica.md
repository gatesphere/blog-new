Hello all,

I just wanted to quickly introduce my latest project, silica. silica is an extremely domain specific language designed to help develop one's musical intuitions and possibly aid in composition. In silica, the featured data type is a note, leading to a language suitable for melodic modelling. It's a bit hard to explain, but here, check out [silica on github](https://github.com/gatesphere/silica/).

Keep tweaking~
