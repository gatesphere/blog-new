Hello,

So, yesterday, I wrote a quick little webapp to allow someone with a smartphone
to count things without looking at the screen.  It's pretty simple, just using
javascript to listen for onClick events on a div, but it was a neat way to 
learn a bit of javascript, as I don't really use it.  As a plus, this is an 
extremely light load...  the entire app is a single html file, and all of
the processing is done clientside.  The interface is minimal to say the least,
and it's fairly intuitive.

If you want to check it out, go to [the WebTally page](http://webtally.suspended-chord.info/).

Thanks for reading!
