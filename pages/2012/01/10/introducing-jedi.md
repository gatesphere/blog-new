Hello everyone,

It's been a while again. But I've been up to interesting things!

The book has been placed on hold for the time being, as I have been working on a few other things. I've started a project called [io-koans](https://github.com/gatesphere/io-koans), which is designed to be an interactive way to learn the Io programming language, through fill-in-the-blank puzzles, in the style of [4clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/). I've also worked my way through the entire [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks) (in significantly fewer than seven weeks...), and I feel I've grown tremendously as a programmer from it. It inspired me, in fact. So much that I've begun probably my most ambitious project to date: the [jedi programming language](https://github.com/gatesphere/jedi). I'll let the github page speak for itself, but I'm having a lot of fun with it.

That's... that, I suppose. Yeah.

Thanks for reading!

Keep tweaking~
