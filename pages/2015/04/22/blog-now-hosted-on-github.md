title: Blog now hosted on github

Phew!  A bunch of work has led me to this point... but, the blog is now running on github pages instead of Heroku. Additionally, it's now Ptah-based.  :)

Hopefully there aren't any differences between old and new (aside from a few cleanups), but who knows?  This migration has taken me close to 10 months of work, off and on... mostly off.  But Heroku's closing of the cedar stack in June really kicked me in the behind to get this going.

Here's to a more active blog again!

Thanks for reading.
