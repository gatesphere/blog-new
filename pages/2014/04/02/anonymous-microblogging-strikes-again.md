title: Anonymous microblogging strikes again

So, it appears an app with remarkably similar functionality to my thrice-ill-fated [ceekrt](http://suspended-chord.info/software-development/miscellaneous-toys/ceekrt/) has popped up.  And they have done it better in every way -- notably, they have snapchat-ified it, meaning that the secrets only show up for a few seconds with no permant (user-facing) records of tweets.  Good show!  This will pretty much eliminate the need for reporting, and prevent any serious abuse of the system.  Now, if only I had thought of that...

Give it a look: [Not Secret App](https://mitroaccess.com/notsecretapp/)

I wish them the best of luck :)
