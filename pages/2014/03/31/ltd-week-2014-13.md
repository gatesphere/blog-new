title: LTD Week 2014 13

Still settling into things in the apartment.  Also didn't have Leo for much of this week due to upgrades and such, so this is incomplete.  Oh well, here goes anyway:

  - Work
    - Worked on various FTP jobs
    - Worked on installing software to newly upgraded desktop PC
  - Responsibility
    - Umm... kept living?
  - Leisure
    - Started playing some Awesomenauts.  That game's cool.
    
Wow, woefully incomplete.  Oh well.
