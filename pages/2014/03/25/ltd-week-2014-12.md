title: LTD Week 2014 12

I moved this weekend (!), so this week wasn't terribly productive.

  - Work
    - Worked on various FTP scripts
    - Integrated a new server into our old monitoring software
    - Tried to fix a web app that a user had broken
  - Responsibility
    - Umm... moved into a new apartment
  - Leisure
    - Fixed a few vr2-related bugs in Leo's core
    - Researched Liquid Democracy
    - Worked a bunch on silica - parameterized macros, syntactic sugar for grouping, repetition factors and glomming, etc...
    - Updated orison's software

Yeah, short list... but a lot of packing/unpacking/shopping.  Oh, and cooking.  Can't forget cooking :)
