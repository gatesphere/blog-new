title: LTD Week 2014 20

Sorry, this is last week's report...  I got caught up in a few things.

Anyways, here's the kind of reporting living a semi-quantified life lets you do nearly 2 weeks after the fact:

  - Work
    - Fixed a few FTP jobs
    - Mirrored a root zpool for one of our servers
    - Moved several servers on to bigger disks
  - Responsibility
    - Cashed a few checks
    - Paid some bills
  - Leisure
    - Started working on a board game design... :)
    - Read a bit of Good Math
    - Read a bit of Queen Zixi of Ix
