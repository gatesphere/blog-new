title: LTD Week 2014 22

I did it again -- two weeks reports back to back.  Ugh.  Here's week 22.

  - Work
    - User accounts
    - Prepping for a database upgrade
  - Responsibility
    - Updating various addresses
    - Bills
  - Leisure
    - A bit of coding
    - A bit of reading (Good Math and Far Away Land RPG)
    - Game design (hehehe)
    - Generally working like a madman on personal projects
