title: LTD Week 2014 02

Fast week, the days blew past me...

  - Work
    - Got my work laptop fixed and up to spec... it's usable again, and that took forever.
    - Investigated some strange issues with blackboard performance -- discovered a db deadlock
    - Created several user accounts
    - Compiled a list of OS versions for a NetBackup upgrade
  - Responsibility
    - Kept on keeping on... various little personal things
    - Kept up with my Tabata routine :)
  - Leisure
    - Added state, intruments, macros (internally), begin/endgroup support to silica
    - Made a logo proposal for Leo (found some issues with the current splash)
    - Finished off Carse's "Finite and Infinite Games" (as evidenced by [my review of it](/2014/01/07/book-review---finite-and-infinite-games/))
    - Read Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"
    - Replaced the tag cloud here on the blog with a flat list (looks nicer to me)
    - Updated orison's software

Phew!
