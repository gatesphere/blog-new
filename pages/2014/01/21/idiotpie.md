title: Idiotpie

So, I stumbled on [this great blogpost about learning how Git works by building it in javascript](http://kushagragour.in/blog/2014/01/build-git-learn-git/), and I thought that it would be neat to build in python.  So... I did.  The result is [here](https://github.com/gatesphere/idiotpie).

It's called 'idiotpie', from 'git' being slang for 'dolt', and 'py' sounding like 'pie'.  Original, I know.

Thanks for reading! :)
