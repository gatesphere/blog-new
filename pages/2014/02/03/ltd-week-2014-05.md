    - Put in a bunch of work on FTP jobs
    - Input some DNS entries
    - Debugged some Javascript issues (lolwut? People trust me with js now?  Uh-oh...)
    - Patched two of our blackboard servers with a critical patch
  - Responsibility
    - Kept up the Tabata routine
  - Leisure
    - Worked on some backend improvements to the blog (more on that in a while)
    - Started on an SFTP edit plugin for Leo
    - Finished up Charles Petzold's 'Code' -- review coming soon
    - Started reading + doing the projects in 'The Elements of Computing Systems'
    - Updated orison's software
