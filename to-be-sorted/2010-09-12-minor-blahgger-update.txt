title: Minor blahgger update
date: 12/09/2010

Another minor update:
I had logic errors in the page bar and the content printing for pages beyond the first. It just cropped up because last post is the first time the blog went beyond the first page (10 posts per page).

I also added a link to the front page under the header. I've been meaning to do that for a while.

That's it.

Keep tweaking~
