title: Blog resources now hosted on github
tags: github, heroku, cloud, downloads

Hi all,

This is a really short update, but I just wanted to let you know that
from now on, all my downloadables from this blog are going to be hosted
on github rather than on heroku.  So, don't be afraid if you see 
github in the download links--that's me, I did that on purpose.

Thanks for reading!
