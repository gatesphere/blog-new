Hi all,

I did a port of [my previous library for the TLV5620](/?c=9) to the MSPhere framework, including the demo. This is classified as an "auxiliary library" since it depends upon the core framework, yet is a bit too specific to be included with it.

Anyways, you can get it at the [MSPhere website](http://msphere.suspended-chord.info/).

Development on the main library and documentation is coming. I am currently busy with classes, but I have some free time this week. I will use that to update the documentation on the [wiki](http://wiki.suspended-chord.info/).

Thanks for reading!

Keep tweaking~
