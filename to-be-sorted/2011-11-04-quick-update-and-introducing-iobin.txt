title: Quick update, and introducing iobin!
date: 04/11/2011

Hello all,

Just a quick update on things. I've began making some progress on the Io Book, more about that to come. It's not much progress, bit it's a start. I'm on a roll, actually :)

Another Io-related project that I'm much more excited for is the initiation of the iobin collection. More info on that in the top bar, but suffice it to say these few quick words: one click binary installers for Io.

Check it out!

Keep tweaking~
