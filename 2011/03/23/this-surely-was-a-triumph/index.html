But, the wheels keep turning.</p><p>Since the last time I wrote, I've accomplished nothing in the domain of MSPhere or JEclap. As far as MSPhere goes, I might end up collaborating with the author of <a href="https://github.com/chrishulbert/friendly_launchpad">"friendly launchpad"</a> in order to streamline the whole process. Things are still up in the air.</p><p>As far as development goes, I'm tied down with classes at the moment, but I have decided that I am going to get some serious work done this summer on my various projects, maybe even bringing <a href="http://suspended-chord.info/portfolio/inprogress/muscover-computing/">Muscover</a> to life. Pretty much the only personal development I've been able to do is my brief step into the realm of algorithmic art, via the use of the <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a> language. Those of you who follow my <a href="http://suspended-chord.deviantart.com/">deviantART page</a> have seen some of the results of that, and I intend to have a larger gallery for display on my portfolio soon, possibly even later today.</p><p>In non-development related news:</p><p>I have also decided to place a donate button on my portfolio page, in an unobtrusive manner. This is not a way to beg for money, but just a way for me to potentially fund my endeavors. So far, everything I've done has been at personal cost to me. I have no problems with any of this, but from this point on, if anyone else feels like assisting, there is now that option available. There may even be a small perk in it for you, who knows... ;)</p><p>I have also started to work on my next release in the A Question Malformed series, Fluid, in earnest. I have some surprises in store, and also a lot of work ahead of me. Fluid will be my first full-length that was actually conceived as an album (the stuff in //shards was just a collection of songs that didn't fit anywhere else), but I hope to have the whole shebang finished by the end of August. I have already recorded 2 out of 12 tracks, and I have around 3 others written. This release is looking to cost me around $170 for the 10 physical copies, so there's another reason for the donate button.</p><p>Anyways, thanks for reading.</p><p>Keep tweaking~</p></section><section class="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script src="http://disqus.com/forums/suschord/embed.js" type="text/javascript"> </script><noscript>&lt;a href="http://suschord.disqus.com/?url=ref"&gt;View the discussion thread.&lt;/a&gt;</noscript><a class="dsq-brlink" href="http://disqus.com">blog comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></section></article></div></section><footer>a→ab is the blog of Jake Peck, also known as <a href="http://suspended-chord.info/">suspended-chord</a></footer><script type="text/javascript">
