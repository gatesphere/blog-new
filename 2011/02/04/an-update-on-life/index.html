Unfortunately, I was unable to do most of the things on that to-do list that I posted a while back. Life got in the way. I'm sure you all know how that is.</p><p>However, I am working on several projects right now. First and foremost is my thesis, which I am also using as a part of my AI course at the moment. Aside from that, I am working on a project for Web Services, which entails me rewriting ceekrt in JavaEE. Fun times :P</p><p>However, I do have some code for MSPhere to release, and I still have the TLV5618A library to port to it. Thanks to a few others, I have some submissions to add and make it more community based. So, be on the lookout for that. Also, I would absolutely love to release JEclap sometime soon. But that requires more work still.</p><p>Blahgger and the current iteration of ceekrt have taken a back seat for now, along with fileslave (which is still an early prototype). Work will resume on those as time permits (maybe this weekend?).</p><p>That's all I've got for now, just wanted to let you all know I'm still alive and kicking. :)</p><p>Keep tweaking~</p></section><section class="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script src="http://disqus.com/forums/suschord/embed.js" type="text/javascript"> </script><noscript>&lt;a href="http://suschord.disqus.com/?url=ref"&gt;View the discussion thread.&lt;/a&gt;</noscript><a class="dsq-brlink" href="http://disqus.com">blog comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></section></article></div></section><footer>a→ab is the blog of Jake Peck, also known as <a href="http://suspended-chord.info/">suspended-chord</a></footer><script type="text/javascript">
