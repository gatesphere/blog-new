I'd like to examine the text editor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_(text_editor)">Acme</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs">Plan 9 from Bell Labs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(operating_system)">Inferno</a>. I think Acme represents a fundamentally different way of interacting with a system than what the vast majority of users use today -- and one I wouldn't have even been inclined to give a shot if I hadn't already been mired in Leo's UI.</p><h1>What is Acme</h1><p>Acme is one of the default text editors for the Plan 9 OS. Plan 9 in itself is fascinating, and a real study on 'the future, yesterday' in OS design... but that's another topic altogether.</p><p>Acme is a mouse-heavy design, which has been optimized for developers, or at least that's what its author claims. I find this approach of mouse-dependence to be refreshing in an increasingly keyboard-is-king UI world. Acme actually <em>requires</em> a three button mouse... but it fully uses those three buttons to their fullest extent.</p><p>Acme also presents what I'm going to call a 'fluid UI'. Everything in Acme is text, and editable text at that. Gone are notions of tabs, widgets, controls, and other traditional UI trappings -- text is king. And it works surprisingly well.</p><h1>Mouse functions</h1><p>As mentioned above, Acme requires three mouse buttons to use. This is due to each of these being assigned a specific action:</p><ul><li>Left: move cursor (click), select (drag)</li><li>Middle: execute (click), select+execute (drag)</li><li>Right: get (click), select+get (drag)</li></ul><p>The left mouse button operates as expected, moving the cursor around the screen and selecting text. The other two are where it gets interesting.</p><p>The right mouse button performs a command called 'get'. This is a combination of things, depending on what you're 'getting':</p><ul><li>Scope: if nothing is highlighted, it's the nearest 'chunk' to the mouse pointer. If something is highlighted and that is right-clicked on, the whole hightlighted item is what 'get' looks for.</li><li>Types:<ul><li>First, 'get' looks for the item as a file or directory. If the item is a directory, 'get' dumps the contents of the dir into a new window. If the item is a file, the contents of the file are dumped into a new window. If the filename has a :linenumber, the cursor is automatically moved to that line.</li><li>Next, it checks if it's a manpage definition, i.e. 'cat(1)'. If so, it loads the manpage in a new window.</li><li>Next, it checks if it's a URI, and if so dumps the contents of that into a new window.</li><li>Finally, if it's none of the above, it performs a wrap-around, case-sensitive search for the chunk in the current window.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Handy!</p><p>Middle mouse acts similar:</p><ul><li>Scope: identical to 'get'</li><li>Types:<ul><li>Shell command, like 'ls -l'. Executes the selected code and dumps the result into a new window.</li><li>Acme command, which do various things:</li><li>'Cut': as expected</li><li>'Del': deletes the current window</li><li>'Delcol': deletes the current column and all it's windows</li><li>'Dump': saves the state of acme to a dumpfile</li><li>'Edit': executes a [Sam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_(text_editor)) command in the current window</li><li>'Exit': as expected</li><li>'Get': load file</li><li>'Load': load dumpfile created by 'Dump'</li><li>'Look': see right-mouse 'get'</li><li>'New': make a new window</li><li>'Newcol': make a new column</li><li>'Paste': as expected</li><li>'Put': write a window to a file</li><li>'Redo': as expected</li><li>'Snarf': called copy in most other editors</li><li>'Undo': as expected</li><li>'Zerox': make a copy of the window with the selected text</li></ul></li></ul><p>It's important to note that as Acme provides a completely fluid interface, all of these are simply typed in and then middle-clicked. No buttons! The interface stays out of your way until you explicitly <em>tell</em> it to exist.</p><h1>Mouse chording</h1><p>The last neat thing that Acme does to squeeze every ounce of utility out of the mouse is mouse-chording, or binding commands to combinations of mouse clicks.</p><p>Select some text with the left button, and while still holding left, middle click is a 'cut'. Right click with left held down is a 'paste'. Left held down, followed by middle then right click is a 'snarf'.</p><p>Double clicking left mouse allows for quick text selection. Beginnings of lines when double clicked select the whole line.</p><p>Fun stuff. I highly suggest giving it a whirl. :)</p></section><section class="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script src="http://disqus.com/forums/suschord/embed.js" type="text/javascript"> </script><noscript>&lt;a href="http://suschord.disqus.com/?url=ref"&gt;View the discussion thread.&lt;/a&gt;</noscript><a class="dsq-brlink" href="http://disqus.com">blog comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></section></article></div></section><footer>a→ab is the blog of Jake Peck, also known as <a href="http://suspended-chord.info/">suspended-chord</a></footer><script type="text/javascript">
