    <p>I've decided to do something new here on the blog.  I think I'm going to take a crack at
short reviews of books I'm reading.  This first entry is on a book I received for Christmas,
that I quickly tore through, as it had been on my to-read list for a long while, and
hits nearly all of my interests: technology, professional wargaming, game design, and
self publishing.  How does it stack up?  Let's see.</p>
<h1>Vitals</h1>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Dark Guest: Training Games for Cyber Warfare</p>
<p><strong>Author(s):</strong> John Curry and Tim Price MBE</p>
<p><strong>Publisher:</strong> lulu.com</p>
<p><strong>Pages:</strong> 87</p>
<p><strong>ISBN:</strong> 978-1-4710-8548-2 (Full color softcover), 978-1-4716-3415-4 (Black &amp; white softcover)</p>
<p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="http://www.wargaming.co/seriousgames/homepage.htm">wargaming.co</a></p>
<h1>Review</h1>
<p>This is a book of four training exercises to stress the importance of IT security to non-technical staff.  In this aspect the book does well, especially for being very nearly alone in it's field -- this is perhaps the only widely-available text on the topic, at the moment, and I use 'widely' very loosely here.</p>
<p>The first of the four games included in the book, which happened to be the one I was least interested in, is a card game titled <em>'Hack This!'</em>. It's extremely simplistic, but absolutely dripping with good educational research. Unfortunately, it also occupies 2/3 of the pages of the book because it's a card game, and has far too many cards to be distributed in a printed book format. Ah well. It looks like it would be a very good teaching tool for non-technical managers, but one can't help but notice the distinct lack of governmental agency in the design -- this is likely due to the fact that prior to the PRISM and X-Keyscore, etc. revelations (this book was written in Summer 2011), people weren't necessarily thinking about governmental actions in cyberspace, but at the same time it feels like a serious oversight given that the book is subtitled "Training Games for Cyber Warfare", as in "That thing that governments do under cover of the net."</p>
<p>Game 2, <em>'Enterprise Defender'</em> is a business simulation thing, a very smooth 'what-if' scenario. Not too much to speak of in rules, but more as a way to help IT managers realize what they're missing in terms of policies and contingency plans. I might actually suggest this to my managers...</p>
<p>Game 3 is a simplified <a href="http://www.wargamedevelopments.org/matrix.htm">Matrix Game</a> titled <em>'All Your Secrets Are Belong to Us'</em>, and it looks fantastic. The one sticking point I have with it is that it represents the hacker collective 'Anonymous' as a single player. But that can't necessarily be avoided. Good ideas and great execution. I'd love to give something like this a go sometime.</p>
<p>Game 4, <em>'Exercise Tallin Soldier'</em> is a <a href="http://www.abbreviations.com/term/18266">CPX</a>-style game centering on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_cyberattacks_on_Estonia">Estonian Internet Crisis of late spring 2007</a>. It is modeled after a highly simplified version of the US' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Storm_Exercise">Exercise Cyber Storm (2006)</a>, reducing players from &gt;1000 to 4, and umpires from &gt;100 to 1. It is extremely railroady -- the exercise and events will unfold no matter what. As an educational tool, I see great use... as a game or a 'realistic' simulation, much less so. Still, a very useful model to grab ideas from... and it was a nice break from the norm with respect to involving the cyber-security realm heavily, as <em>all</em> of the attacks are purely infrastructurally targeted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ddos#Distributed_attack">DDoS</a>s.</p>
<h1>My Score</h1>
<p>It is a good read, but not without its blunders. For example, there are a large number of typos, and none of the images are scaled correctly, causing grainy, unclear artifacts in the text. But it is a self-published work, and that is to be expected -- it's such a niche work that no traditional publisher in their right minds would pick it up, as the profit margins are neigh non-existant. It is perhaps the best text in the field, simply because there are no other texts in the field... which is a shame, but it certainly gives me ideas.</p>
<p>Overall, I'd give it a <strong>5/7</strong>.</p>
