I have written haiku, etc, before, but never did so with any strict adherence to the form. I thought I'd do a quick comparison of the various forms I've come across that tickled my fancy, and perhaps include some examples. It's an excuse to write a bit more...</p><p>Most of this post is informed by these two links:</p><ul><li><a href="http://lestersmith.com/2009/05/29/poetic-forms-haiku-senryu-tanka-and-lunes/">Poetic Forms: Haiku, Senryu, Tanka, and Lunes</a></li><li><a href="http://lestersmith.com/2009/06/30/next-up-soji/">Next Up: Sijo</a></li></ul><h1>Haiku</h1><p>The most well known structured syllabic style, by far. English Haiku are known for being three lines long, structured with five/seven/five syllables. But that isn't a complete definition... no, haiku also need a seasonal word to ground them in nature, and a conceptual break after either the first or second line. That second bit is much less known, but makes Haiku well formed -- a haiku is presented as two individual thoughts, around a common nature-tied theme. Lets see if I can pull it off:</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">rustling</span> <span class="n">leaves</span> <span class="n">flit</span>
<span class="n">passively</span> <span class="n">down</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">wet</span> <span class="n">soil</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">wind</span> <span class="n">beckons</span> <span class="n">my</span> <span class="n">grin</span>
</pre></div><h1>Senryu</h1><p>Haiku which do not have a seasonal word but follow the other conventions of the haiku form are called senryu. Here's a shot at one of those:</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="s">"Be careful!"</span> <span class="n">cried</span> <span class="n">Shen</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="n">watching</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">boy</span> <span class="n">run</span> <span class="n">through</span> <span class="n">cars</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="n">far</span> <span class="n">too</span> <span class="n">late</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">save</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div><h1>Tanka</h1><p>An extended form of the senryu, the tanka is a syllabic poem split into lines of five/seven/five/seven/seven syllables. The important idea is that the tanka encompasses a micro/macro structure, where each line has its own concept that builds within the larger piece as a whole. Might as well give it a whack:</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">am</span> <span class="n">gunslinger</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="n">terror</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">dusty</span> <span class="n">plains</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="n">my</span> <span class="n">weapon</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">law</span>
<span class="n">ushered</span> <span class="n">in</span> <span class="n">with</span> <span class="n">red</span> <span class="n">hot</span> <span class="n">lead</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="n">Under</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">sun</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">am</span> <span class="n">truth</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div><h1>Lune</h1><p>A lune is a shortened version of a haiku, such that the three lines have five/three/five syllables. Very short, very succinct. Let's give it a go:</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">somehow</span> <span class="n">I</span> <span class="n">got</span> <span class="n">here</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">coming</span>
<span class="n">remains</span> <span class="n">confounding</span>
</pre></div><h1>Sijo</h1><p>Sijo is a Korean form of poetry that is somewhat like a more complex and longer form of senryu. Sijo poems are three lines long, with each line serving a distinct purpose: line one introduces a theme, line two develops the theme presented in line one, and line three provides a twist on the theme, and then resolves it within the context of the rest of the poem. Each of these lines is between fourteen and sixteen syllables, broken into smaller phrases of between three to five syllables each, lending the full poem fourty-four to fourty-six syllables to work with. Sijo offer much more room to work with, so they are seen as more flexible than haiku or senryu. I just discovered this form today, so here's an attempt at it that will probably leave a lot to be desired:</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">Cool</span> <span class="n">calculation</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">machine</span> <span class="n">rumbles</span> <span class="n">doing</span> <span class="n">its</span> <span class="n">thing</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="n">Crunching</span> <span class="n">numbers</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="n">grand</span> <span class="n">purpose</span> <span class="n">among</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">chaos</span><span class="p">,</span> 
<span class="n">but</span> <span class="n">wait</span><span class="o">!</span> <span class="n">A</span> <span class="n">bug</span> <span class="n">shows</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">slowing</span> <span class="n">us</span> <span class="n">down</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">observe</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">code</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="n">fix</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div><h1>Etheree</h1><p>Etheree poems are composed of ten lines, each with one more syllable than the last, with the first line starting with one syllable. They're fun to write, and really give you something to think about with your syllable budget. Variations on the etheree are the reversed form, where you start with ten syllables and work your way down to one, the double etheree, where you start with one, work up to ten, and then work back down to one, and the triple, quadruple, etc. etheree which just build on that theme. Here's a standard, one-to-ten etheree I wrote a few weeks ago:</p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">You</span>
<span class="n">were</span> <span class="n">small</span>
<span class="n">yet</span> <span class="n">potent</span>
<span class="n">back</span> <span class="n">when</span> <span class="n">we</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">in</span>
<span class="n">no</span> <span class="n">uncertain</span> <span class="n">terms</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="n">believed</span> <span class="n">that</span> <span class="n">dragons</span> <span class="n">breathed</span>
<span class="n">fire</span> <span class="n">and</span> <span class="n">ice</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">dancing</span> <span class="n">warmth</span>
<span class="n">over</span> <span class="n">our</span> <span class="n">well</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">worn</span> <span class="n">sheets</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">blankets</span>
<span class="n">and</span> <span class="n">pillows</span> <span class="n">aligned</span> <span class="n">in</span> <span class="n">perfect</span> <span class="n">walls</span>
<span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">keep</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">world</span> <span class="n">tucked</span> <span class="n">away</span> <span class="n">from</span> <span class="n">our</span> <span class="n">hearts</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div><h1>Why do all of this?</h1><p>Poetry is fun, and a great way to unravel the mind. We all need a break, and poetry reminds us of that. It is a deeply human experience, and one that I feel everyone should give a passing try at.</p></section><section class="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script src="http://disqus.com/forums/suschord/embed.js" type="text/javascript"> </script><noscript>&lt;a href="http://suschord.disqus.com/?url=ref"&gt;View the discussion thread.&lt;/a&gt;</noscript><a class="dsq-brlink" href="http://disqus.com">blog comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></section></article></div></section><footer>a→ab is the blog of Jake Peck, also known as <a href="http://suspended-chord.info/">suspended-chord</a></footer><script type="text/javascript">
