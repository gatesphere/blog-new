Yeesh, what a niche. But there are a few franchises that I think exemplify the genre, perhaps most notably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasy_Star_Online">Phantasy Star Online</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter">Monster Hunter</a>. Both are focused around collecting a large amount of items and upgrades, customizing your character with different weapons and armor, and killing things in a tactical action-oriented combat system. I'm writing this post because I recently began my foray into the Monster Hunter series with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter_3_Ultimate#Monster_Hunter_3_Ultimate">Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate</a>. I sincerely think SEGA needs to bring PSO to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U">Wii U</a>, but I doubt that will happen... so instead I have MH3U to scratch my itch.</p><p>One thing that's pretty integral to this genre of games is the grind -- doing the same thing repeatedly to gain resources in order to improve your character, either via equipment or statistics. When you take a mile-back look at the idea of grinding, it seems like an exercise in futility... doing the same thing over and over again? How can that be fun?</p><p>The human mind is pretty interesting when it comes to patterns and repetitions. I have a feeling that grinding in games is all about hitting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleasure_center">pleasure centers</a> in the brain -- we like feeling rewarded for our work, so when a game provides instant feedback, we have a rush of feel-good brain activity. There's likely some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning">classical conditioning</a> in there too -- we're shown through gameplay itself that if we work hard we'll be rewarded. Compound this with the human mind's <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/brain-seeks-patterns-where-none-exi-08-10-03/">desire for patterns</a> and the feel-good effect can be even greater.</p><p>If you're interested in a slightly deeper look at the topic, I suggest reading <a href="http://www.louisestigell.com/2013/02/why-we-love-or-hate-to-grind.html">Why we love (or hate) to grind</a> over on Louise Stigell's site. It's a good read.</p></section><section class="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script src="http://disqus.com/forums/suschord/embed.js" type="text/javascript"> </script><noscript>&lt;a href="http://suschord.disqus.com/?url=ref"&gt;View the discussion thread.&lt;/a&gt;</noscript><a class="dsq-brlink" href="http://disqus.com">blog comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></section></article></div></section><footer>a→ab is the blog of Jake Peck, also known as <a href="http://suspended-chord.info/">suspended-chord</a></footer><script type="text/javascript">
