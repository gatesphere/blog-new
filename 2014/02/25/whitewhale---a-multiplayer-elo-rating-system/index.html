Note, it diverges from Elo in several points.</p><p>Let \(E_x\) be the Expected score of player \(x\), \(N\) be the number of participants, \(T_x\) be the numerical rank of player \(x\), \(S_x\) be the actual score of player \(x\), \(R_x\) be the rating of player \(x\), where \(100\) is a decent average, \(R'_x\) be the new rating of player \(x\), \(\sigma\) be the average rating of all the players of a given game, \(K_x\) be the \(K\)-value for player \(x\), and \(P_x\) be the number of rated games that player \(x\) has played.</p><p>First, we find the expected score for each player:</p><p>$$Q_x = (\sigma - R_x) / 20$$ $$E_x = \frac{1}{1 + 10**{Q_x}}$$</p><p>(Where \(**\) is exponentiation. Superscripts are not possible here due to a conflict between markdown and mathjax...)</p><p>Then we determine the actual score for each player:</p><p>$$S_x = \frac{N - T_x}{N - 1}$$</p><p>Next we determine the \(K\) value for the player:</p><p>$$K_x = \frac{50}{P_x}$$</p><p>Finally, we use this to determine the new rating of the player:</p><p>$$R'_x = R_x + K_x (S_x - E_x)$$</p><p>Now, what to do in case of ties? Simple -- all tied partcipants are dropped down to a single rank. So, in a 10-player game (i.e., \(N = 10\)), if 4 people tied for third place, they all have a \(T_x\) of \(6\).</p><p>This system is automatically scaled so new players have more volatile ratings than established players, so that their scores level out and reflect their true skill eventually. However, once a player is past 50 games, it is difficult if not impossible to significantly change their rating, so perhaps this needs to be reworked.</p><p>It's not perfect, but it was fun to come up with :)</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p></section><section class="comments"><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script src="http://disqus.com/forums/suschord/embed.js" type="text/javascript"> </script><noscript>&lt;a href="http://suschord.disqus.com/?url=ref"&gt;View the discussion thread.&lt;/a&gt;</noscript><a class="dsq-brlink" href="http://disqus.com">blog comments powered by <span class="logo-disqus">Disqus</span></a></section></article></div></section><footer>a→ab is the blog of Jake Peck, also known as <a href="http://suspended-chord.info/">suspended-chord</a></footer><script type="text/javascript">
